Hardware implementation

Run ```parameters_calculate.m``` to calculate the TO trajectory swin-up control, LQR coefficient nearing upright, and sample time T.

Run ```load_parameters.m``` to load the saved (Config.mat) parameters.

Next run from Simulink (hardware.slx)...

There might be some misleading function names (like PFL_LQR). Actually we were trying to do with it first, but it's actually LQR. We appologize for it.
